❓ Answers to Questions:
1. Difference between var, let, and const

  Ans:  - **var**: Function scoped. It can be re-declared and updated.
        - **let**: Block scoped. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
        - **const**: Block scoped. It cannot be re-assigned after declaration.

2. What is the Spread Operator (...)?

  Ans:- The spread operator (`...`) is used to expand elements of an array or properties of an object.

        Example:

            ```javascript
                const numbers = [1,2,3];
                const newNumbers = [...numbers,4];

3. Difference between map(), filter(), and forEach()

  Ans:- 
        - map() → Returns a new array after transforming each element.
        - filter() → Returns a new array with elements that match a condition.
        - forEach() → Loops through the array but does not return a new array.

1. What is an Arrow Function?

  Ans:- An arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript.

        Example:

            ```javascript
                const add = (a, b) => a + b;

1. What are Template Literals?

  Ans:- Template literals allow us to create strings with variables using backticks ` `.

        Example:

            ```javascript
                const name = "Nafiz";
                const text = `Hello ${name}`;
